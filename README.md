## ðŸš€ Hello
This was created as a portfolio website template you can clone. Great right? 

All you need to do is;

1. **Clone the repo**
1. **Run _npm install_**
1. **To start the development server, run _gatsby develop_**
1. **If your IDE doesn't automatically open up the development server after _gatsby develop_ runs, then click on the links available on the terminal or simply go to your browser and type _https://localhost:8000_**

Enjoy!! ðŸš€ðŸš€
